This is a workshop for my Algorithms and Programming 1 class. It contains various exercises that
achieve different operations with strings, numbers and arrays. In the first part you can work with 
strings and see stuff like the string length, the concatenation of strings, and select a character.
With the numbers you can divide them, their whole parts and see the remainder. As for the arrays,
you can print the arrays, calculate the average of the elements of the array, see the maximum value
in the array, generate new arrays by adding, subtracting or multiplying arrays, generate new arrays
by uniting them with or without repetition or intercepting them, spin an array, and finally ordering
from least to greatest the elements of an array.
